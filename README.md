# countHours

### How to use:- <br/>
Entered timestamp:<br/>
10:00 12:00 1:00 2:00 3:00 5:00 12:00 2:00 <br/><br/>
Converted into 24 hours format:<br/>
10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 24, 2. <br/><br/>
There is a break after each even entry.<br/>
Total hours: 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 hrs<br/><br/>
It can only count the time if the total timestamps are even. It can understand the time sequence. So don't hesitate to test the project.

### Aim:
This project aims to calculate the total hours spent after a certain task. The issue with other time calculators available online is that we must enter the time in 24 hours format of 12 hours with AM/PM. It's great but this small project helps to override this limitation and helps the person to count hours quickly.

### Contribution:
If anyone feels that they want to contribute to the project by adding any more functionality then the project is open for the change.
